## ⚠️ Note on Notebook Rendering

GitHub is currently unable to render the file `Srishti_ConvNextLargeLatest_Eval_All3DBv4_Evaluation.ipynb` and a few others because of internal widget metadata issues (`metadata.widgets.state` key is missing). This notebook contains full output and was intentionally preserved for evaluation purposes.

To view this notebook with outputs:

1. **Download** the notebook.
2. **Open locally** using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension.

> For GitHub-friendly viewing, please refer to the notebook version in the folder `Rendered File without output`, which contains the same code without outputs (cleared using `nbconvert`).

This setup allows evaluators to access both:
- The raw code in a GitHub-renderable format.
- The full results and output in a locally viewable format.

Thank you!
